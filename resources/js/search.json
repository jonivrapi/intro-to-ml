Unlike traditional programming, where rules are explicitly coded by a developer, ML enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed."]},{"l":"Machine Learning vs. Artificial Intelligence vs. Deep Learning","p":["Artificial Intelligence (AI): A broad discipline in computer science aiming to create systems capable of intelligent behavior. It encompasses everything from rule-based systems to sophisticated learning algorithms.","Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI, machine learning algorithms enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. ML is about data and algorithms, not explicit programming of rules.","Deep Learning (DL): A subset of ML, deep learning uses neural networks with many layers (hence \"deep\") to learn from vast amounts of data. It's particularly powerful for tasks like image and speech recognition, but is very data hungry. Given enough compute and data, however, these models are broadly state of the art (SOTA) in most tasks today."]},{"l":"Importance of Machine Learning","p":["Machine learning is reshaping many aspects of our lives. Its applications range from everyday conveniences like recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon) to critical uses in healthcare (e.g., predicting diseases, personalized medicine), finance (e.g., fraud detection), and beyond.
