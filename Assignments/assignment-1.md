# Assignment 1

We will be working with the `Iris Dataset` -- typically used as the `Hello world!` of machine learning projects. This dataset can be found in `sklearn datasets`. You can find the jupyter notebook for this assignment [here](https://github.com/jonivrapi/intro-to-ml/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment-1.ipynb).

Import the dataset and do a sanity check:


```python

```

**Question 1:** How many datapoints are in this dataset?


```python

```

**Question 2:** How many columns (features) are there? 


```python

```

**Question 3:** What are the datatypes of each feature?


```python

```

**Question 4:** What is the target feature name?


```python

```

**Question 5:** How many target categories are there?


```python

```

Create a correlation matrix for the features in this dataset.


```python

```

Create a pairwise plot of all the features in this dataset.


```python

```

Speculate as to which features would be most useful for classification based on the above two plots.


```python

```

Set up your training and testing datasets.


```python

```

Train decision tree, SVM, NB and MLP classifiers.


```python

```

Report classification accuracies.




```python

```
