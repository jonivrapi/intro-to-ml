# Assignment 1

We will be working with the `Iris Dataset` -- typically used as the `Hello world!` of machine learning projects. This dataset can be found in the `sklearn datasets`. You can find the jupyter notebook for this assignment [here].

Questions to answer:
1. How many data points are there in this dataset?
2. How many columns (features)?
3. What are the datatypes of each feature?
4. What is the target feature name?
5. How many target categories are there?

Things to do:
1. Create a correlation matrix for the features in this dataset.
2. Create a pairwise plot of all the features for this dataset.
3. After creating these, speculate as to which features would be most useful for classification.
4. Set up your train-test-split for training your models.
5. Train a Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naieve Bayes (NB), and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) on the training set.
6. Report each of their classification accuracies.
